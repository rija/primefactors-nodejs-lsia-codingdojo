# Prime Factors of Positive Integer Number


## Definition

The prime factorisation of a positive integer is a list of the integer's prime factors, together with their multiplicities.

to shorten prime number factorisations, factors are often expressed in powers (multiplicities).

example:

```
360 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 5 = 2^3 x 3^2 x 5
```
For a prime factor `p` of `n`, the multiplicity of `p` is the largest exponent `a` for which `p^a` divides n exactly.

## TODO

Write a program that returns the list of prime factors for all positive integers from 1 to 100.
